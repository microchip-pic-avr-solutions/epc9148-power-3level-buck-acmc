# epc9148-power-3level-buck-acmc, release v1.0.0

### Release Highlights
Robust initial release for the EPC9148 250W Ultra-Thin 48V 3-Level Synchronous Buck Converter Reference Design running in average current mode control with flying capacitor voltage balancing achieving 97.8% peak efficiency.

### Features Added\Updated
This code example demonstrates an average current mode control with additional flying capacitor voltage balancing implementation for dsPIC33CK. It has specifically been developed for the EPC9148 Ultra-Thin Three-Level Synchronous Buck Converter Reference Design.
